## Description
This app seeks to create a fun and interactive user experience where the user can share their opinion of restaurants and explore the "Rants" of other users. For this app to work properly we will need to use all of the "CRUD" methods to move data between the front and back ends. Additionally we aim to make the user interface beautiful an easy to use.

## Restaurants
Users will be able to create and view restaurants. Each restaurant will have:
- A name
- City
- State
- List of cuisines
- A Photo

## Rants
For each restaurant, users will be able to create their own "Rants" this is the opportunity to (hopefully politely) share their opinions of that restaurant.
